#Clarke Social App

##Description
Clarke is a social network app that allows users to connect with their family and friends on a social media platform. Users can follow their friends, post pictures and post status updates.

##Explanation & General Approach
This is a full-stack app utilizing Jade, Express, Node, Mongoose and MongoDB. Jade was the templating language used to enable the HTML coding. Express is the Node.js web application framework that was used to design our multi-page app. We also used a Node object modeling package, Mongoose, allowing us to reference other models and to access the MongoDB commands to perform CRUD actions in our app.
